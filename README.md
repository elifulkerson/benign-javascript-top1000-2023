This respository contains a sample set of (assumed) benign JavaScript samples, which were collected by scraping the top 1000 website domains in Autum 2023.

The set includes both externally referenced .js files and embeded JavaScript scripts.  Files have been de-duplicated and saved in the format [md5sum].js

This set is intended for research use only - for instance as a comparison set during research into identification of malicious JavaScript.
